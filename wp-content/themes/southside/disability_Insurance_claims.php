                            <h3>Disability Insurance Claims</h3>
                            <p>If you find yourself permanently unable to work for whatever reason, you may be entitled to claim compensation from your insurance cover, that is sometimes attached to your compulsory superannuation policy that your employer has been making compulsory contributions to as part of your wages.<br><br> These claims are referred to as TPD claims.(Total and Permanent Disability claims).Not all superannuation policies have the TPD component, but many do. If you are no longer able to work, you may have an entitlement to a lump sum payment or in some instances an additional temporary income protection entitlement.<br><br> We can assist you with these claims. Sometimes further investigations are required to see if you have an entitlement and sometimes the insurer may refuse to make the payment. The refusal is often based on the insurerâ€™s ruling that you may have a residual work capacity and therefore are not totally and permanently disabled. These claims can become complicated as medical evidence will need to be obtained and your policy will need to be carefully considered to ascertain whether you are being denied a proper payout.<br><br> If you are unsure of your position or have been refused a payout to which you believe you are entitled, we can at Southside Legal assist you to review your position and strongly represent you if there is a valid claim to be made.</p>
