<h3>Professional Negligence</h3>
<p>When mistakes are made by professionals the consequences can be severe. Financial loss or in some instances personal injury can result. However, professionals owe a duty of care to their clients and if held to breach this duty compensation can be claimed. Often these claims are not straightforward and it is essential to obtain experienced advice when seeking an assessment of your position. Southside Lawyers have substantial experience in these matters. The principal of the firm has acted for many claimants and has previously acted for defendant insurers in these matters. The knowledge gained in these previous cases can be utilised to your advantage if you believe you may have a claim. A no obligation enquiry can be made at any time.<br><br> It is important to note that almost all professionals hold professional indemnity insurance. As such it is not the professional who will be paying the compensation to you on a successful claim, but the insurer. Sometimes professionals will readily accept they have made a mistake and have not performed their duties to an acceptable level. Compensation can usually be secured relatively promptly in these circumstances, but regularly the insurer will vigorously defend the matter and it is essential to secure an early experienced opinion on where you stand. Often it is important to obtain the opinion of another expert and Southside Legal has good connections to secure the appropriate expert.<br><br> Typical examples of professional negligence claims include claims made against lawyers, doctors, accountants, financial advisors, engineers, brokers and building inspectors.<br><br> It is necessary to be able to establish that the loss you suffered arose from the actual negligence of the professional. This can on occasion be a very complex task and if negligence can be established the insurer will be trying as hard as possible to reduce the damages payable. Southside Legal can lead you through the difficult issues and we will ensure you are informed as soon as possible in straightforward language just where you stand.<br><br>Time limitations apply to professional negligence claims and early notification provisions apply to certain types of claims. If you believe you may have a claim we urge you to contact us as soon as possible to find out on a no obligation basis, whether there is merit to your claim and whether further investigations are justified. In certain approved matters Southside Legal will run your case on the basis that no professional fees are payable by you until there has been a successful completion of your claim. In most successful cases the majority of the costs and outlays are paid by the defendant insurer.</p>
